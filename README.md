# apportionment-app

Web app for computing apportionment methods, available at https://pref.tools/apportionment.

To use, just open `apportionment.html` in a web browser, served from a web server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`). The app is written in JavaScript and does not require any server-side processing. The script doing the calculations is in `apportionment.js`, which is derived from the Python scripts by Martin Lackner: https://github.com/martinlackner/apportionment.
